### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris Beltz and I am a PhD Candidate at Yale University in the School of the Environment. I am an environmental scientist, an ecologist, and an aspiring data geek. I have four years of experience programming in R.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on analyzing data to examine the effect of changing water and nitrogen availability on dry ecosystems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and expanding my ability to conduct bioinformatic analyses on large datasets.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research related to ecosystem structure-function or developing better open science/data practices.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about some of my research, the importance of sandwiches to my mental well-being, or why diet Coke is clearly superior.
