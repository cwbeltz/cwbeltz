### Hi there 👋

Hi there 👋
My name is Chris Beltz and I am a PhD Candidate at Yale University in the School of the Environment. I am an environmental scientist, an ecologist, and an aspiring data geek. I have four years of experience programming in R.

🔭 I’m currently working on analyzing data to examine the effect of changing water and nitrogen availability on how dry ecosystems function.
🌱 I’m currently learning Python, expanding my ability to conduct bioinformatic analyses on large datasets, and (trying to) always be reading a science fiction novel for fun.
👯 I’m looking to collaborate on research related to ecosystem structure-function relationships or developing/teaching better open science and open data practices.
💬 Ask me about some of my research, the importance of sandwiches to my mental well-being, or why diet Coke is clearly superior to diet Pepsi.
📫 How to reach me: Twitter via @BeltzEcology

⚡ Fun fact: I hiked the southern thousand miles of the Appalachian Trail.
