### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Chris Beltz](christopherbeltz.com) and I am a PhD Candidate at Yale University in the School of the Environment. I am an environmental scientist, an ecologist, and an aspiring data geek. I have four years of experience programming in R with some additional experience in UNIX, bash, and Python.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on analyzing data to examine the effect of changing water and nitrogen availability on dry ecosystems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Python and expanding my ability to conduct bioinformatic analyses on large datasets.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research related to ecosystem structure-function or to develop better open science/data practices.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about some of my research, the importance of sandwiches to my mental well-being, or why diet Coke is clearly superior.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Twitter via [@BeltzEcology](twitter.com/BeltzEcology)!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I hiked the southern thousand miles of the Appalachian Trail.



Some past projects:

- ðŸ“œ mapping - a [simple script](https://github.com/cwbeltz/Sketch.002_Locus.Map) for creating a locus map with site locations as a PDF or PNG.
- ðŸŒ³ sagebrush - a [research publication](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0206563) examing the ability to use nitrogen fertilization in rangeland mitigation
